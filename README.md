# Heart Disease Prediction

This project consists of an artificial intelligence model that can predict whether a person has heart disease or not. It was implemented in Python using the Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Requirements for Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, make sure you have the following apps and libraries installed (version are the one used):

- Python 3.10.6
- Jupyter Notebook 6.5.2
- numpy 1.23.5
- pandas 1.5.3
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- sklearn 1.2.1
- seaborn 0.12.2
- imblearn 0.10.1

## How to Run

To run the project, simply open the Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells.

## Overview

Our team conducted a comprehensive analysis to predict heart disease by examining the available information. We followed a systematic approach, including data exploration, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model evaluation, addressing data imbalance, feature selection, and cross-validation. Here are the main steps we took:

- Verified the available information and relevant variables for heart disease prediction.
- Loaded the data into Python using the Pandas library and verified variable types.
- Conducted scatterplots to explore relationships between variables.
- Ensured data completeness by checking for missing data and assessed the dataset size.
- Examined variable characteristics, distributions, and statistics.
- Compared the heart disease label with other variables to identify relationships.
- Constructed a correlation matrix to quantify variable relationships.
- Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Utilized ordinal encoding for age categories.
- Trained and evaluated various machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
- Addressed data imbalance using oversampling and undersampling techniques.
- Performed feature selection to identify the most relevant features.
- Explored feature extraction to improve model efficiency.
- Employed cross-validation to assess model performance.
